    "# Object Detection for Airtime Scratchcard Digits\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Hello everyone! In this project, I will focus on the task of converting Safaricom and Telkom scratchcard airtime images into digits that can be used to load airtime. In the past, there was an app called \"RechargeKing\" that allowed users to load airtime by capturing images of scratchcards. However, recent changes in the fonts of Safaricom and Telkom scratch cards have rendered the app obsolete as the developers did not update it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "The problem I aim to solve is the digit recognition from scratchcard images. I want to create a solution that can automatically extract the airtime digits from these images, allowing users to easily load airtime without manual input.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "To tackle this problem, I will leverage Nicholas Renotte's TensorFlow Object Detection course, which provides a comprehensive guide on using TensorFlow for object detection. This course will serve as my foundation to build an object detection model capable of recognizing and extracting the digits from scratchcard images. I will use Python for coding and follow the principles outlined in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n"

    "# Steps to Achieve Object Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Install and Setup**: We'll start by setting up our development environment and installing the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collect Images and Label**: Next, we'll gather a dataset of images that contains the objects we want to detect. We'll also label these objects to train our model effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Models**: The heart of object detection is training models. I'll explain how to use pre-trained models or train custom ones to identify objects in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Detecting Objects**: Once our models are trained, we'll apply them to real-world images to detect and locate objects accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Freezing and Conversion**: We'll discuss how to freeze and convert our trained model into a format suitable for deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Performance Tuning**: Object detection isn't just about accuracy; it's also about performance. We'll optimize our models for speed and efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Packaging**: Finally, I'll guide you on packaging your object detection solution for practical use.\n",
